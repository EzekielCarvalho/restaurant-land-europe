//findByIdAndDelete used in app.js to delete restaurants, triggers the middleware "findOneAndDelete" so that is what we have to use to delete all reviews plus the restaurant

//Pre middleware functions are executed one after another, when each middleware calls next.
//post middleware are executed after the hooked method and all of its pre middleware have completed.
//The remove() (deprecated) function is used to remove the documents from the database according to the condition.
//deleteMany is used to delete many

//In Mongoose, a virtual is a property that is not stored in MongoDB. Virtuals are typically used for computed properties on documents.
//ref to https://mongoosejs.com/docs/tutorials/virtuals.html for further info. By default, Mongoose does not include virtuals when you convert a document to JSON. You have to use "opts" for this
// you can only add virtual properties (a Mongoose feature) to a schema. We want to add a virtual property of making images as thumbnails in the Edit page for each restaurant

Also we're trying to conver virtuals to JSON by adding the popup feature for our cluster map. By default, Mongoose does not include virtuals when you convert a document to JSON.  Hence this code had to be used to set virtuals to true. THis is used when we're working with getting the cluster map to have pop up features that we want.
